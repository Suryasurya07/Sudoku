# Sudoku Game

## Overview
This project is a simple Sudoku game built with React. It includes a grid for the puzzle, a timer, and the ability to validate, solve, and give hints. The game is fully interactive and allows users to input their own solutions.

## Features:
- Timer
- Puzzle validation
- Automatic puzzle solver
- Hints

## Approach

### Validation Logic:
- The validation function checks if the puzzle is valid by ensuring there are no repeating numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids. This function uses the `isValidSudoku` function.

### Solving Algorithm:
- The puzzle solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution. It fills in the grid with numbers and backtracks if a number leads to an invalid state.

## Steps to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-game.git
